                <p>Introduction to Neuroscience is designed for undergraduate students enrolled in introductory
                    neuroscience courses. This book specifically targets students enrolled in Introduction to
                    Neuroscience 1 and Introduction to Neuroscience 2 at Michigan State University and primarily
                    contains topics covered in those courses.

                    <br>
                    This first edition will guide students through the structure and function of nervous system cells
                    and nervous system structures, signaling within the nervous system, and introduce various sensory
                    systems. A future edition that will be completed in spring 2023 will include the somatosensory
                    system, motor systems, motivation and reward, stress, sex and the brain, emotions, nervous system
                    disorders, learning, and memory.

                    <p>Neuroplasticity, also known as neural plasticity or brain plasticity, is a process that involves
                        adaptive structural and functional changes to the brain. It is defined as the ability of the
                        nervous system to change its activity in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli by
                        reorganizing its structure, functions, or connections after injuries, such as a stroke or
                        traumatic brain injury (TBI).

                        <br>
                        This activity describes neuroplasticity, the evaluation and
                        management of neuroplasticity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving
                        care for patients.
                        Plasticity after injury: Neuroplasticity is a complicated process that is still being
                        elucidated; however, the concept can be applied in the setting of injury to the brain.
                        Neuroplasticity is traditionally thought of as occurring in 3 phases or epochs

                                from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
